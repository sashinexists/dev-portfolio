I’ve been able to keep a close eye on the quality of my sleep night to night and even take steps to reliably improve it.</p>\n<p>Steps I’ve taken have included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular eating and sleeping times</li>\n<li>Warming up soon up after waking (usually with a hot drink)</li>\n<li>Avoiding oily or hard to digest foods for dinner</li>\n<li>Having an early and smaller dinner and getting used to going to sleep a little hungry</li>\n<li>Making sure that my room isn’t too warm at night (it’s better to be uncomfortably cold than warm)</li>\n<li>Winding down a few hours before bed, using this time to relax and minimising screen use</li>\n<li>Wearing blue light blocking glasses a few hours before bed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a more in depth list please have a look in <a href=\"https://sashinexists.com/vault\">my vault</a> where I’ve written a guide to sleeping.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"still-acquiring-japanese\">Still Acquiring Japanese</h3>\n<p>I am attending Zoom lessons with a Japanese school three times a week Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>\n<p>Or in Japanese: 月曜日、水曜日、金曜日<br>\n(pronounced “Getsuyoubi, Suiyoubi and Kinyoubi”)</p>\n<p>I’m also diligently using the app <a href=\"https://kanji.garden/\">Kanji Garden</a> every day which has been very pleasant. Every I learn about five new Kanji. At this rate I’ll know all two thousand of the common-use ones some time next year (at 400 at the moment).</p>\n<p>I’ve also been listening to Japanese audio most days. I enjoy listening to the audio of Ghibli movies in the morning and evenings. Recently I’ve been reading through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba%26!\">the manga よつばと！</a> (pronounced “Yotsubato”, which means “with Yotsuba!”) which has been really pleasant. It’s recommended as being very friendly for beginners.</p>\n<p>I want to establish a daily reading routine on the days that I don’t have Japanese class. When I feel like I’ve carved out some more free time I’d love to visit more Japanese video chatrooms too.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"diving-into-writing-again\">Diving into Writing Again</h3>\n<p>The great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann\">Niklas Luhmann</a> who invented the <a href=\"https://sashinexists.com/letter/notes-about-notes-bonus-notes-included/\">Zettelkasten method of notetaking</a> for his own personal use, was said to have build an impressive body of work with an average of just six notes a day. I want to also build this habit.</p>\n<p>I’ve certainly been working on it. One such step I’ve taken was buying a physical notebook that I’ve been writing my thoughts in during my aforementioned “wind down” time before sleeping. During the day I tend to write notes straight into Obsidian on my laptop or my phone.</p>\n<p>I have recently written up a new <a href=\"https://sashinexists.com/about\">About page</a> to describe what it is I actually want to accomplish with my writing and who it is I am. I want to polish it up a bit, more specifically I want to rewrite that last section “the future of writing” to be clearer and more relevant.</p>\n<p>I will get to all of this when once I’m done with getting acquainted with my new job and am able to reliably earn money with free time to spare.</p>\n<p>My hope is that this will be within two months from now (May 2022). See you all then!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"622565e6e4c7c90df9d29e71","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-03-07T12:54:46.000+11:00","updated_at":"2022-11-22T03:57:11.000+11:00","published_at":"2022-03-07T14:11:43.000+11:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-now","canonical_url":null,"url":"https://sashinexists.com/now/march-7th-2022/","excerpt":"I'm taking a break from most of the activities in my life (read more about them on my previous Now page.\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Home in Functional Programming\n\n\nRecently, I've been hired by Zipflow as a Full-Stack developer.

I've also been learning about learning about Japanese. I've also been learning about learning in general.</p><p>This is an experiment in self-directed learning.</p><p>In the foreground, I am guessing as to what the best activity is to engage in next, how can I become a little closer to fluency?</p><p>In the background, I am watching myself learn and trying to see how much of this is applicable elsewhere: How do we learn best?</p><p>Rather than following a set course or curriculum, I want to be learning-by-doing and following the fun. I want to learn by attempting to use the language, getting stuck and having the process reveal what I need to know next.</p><p>Knowing why I am learning a specific part of the language like <em>verb conjugation</em> and understanding what specifically I'll be able to do with it makes the process less forced, arbitrary and dull. It <em>becomes</em> engaging, and is less of a ritual and more of an active process. Doing everything in a set order and not knowing <em>why</em> you are doing it is a recipe for boredom, and I believe more often than not failure.</p><p>I have been thinking a lot about learning and what are the best ways to do it, and testing my ideas here by putting them to the test in my learning.</p><p>This was a short description of what I'm doing.</p><p>If you are interested in reading the full how and why of my language learning adventures, check out my 2020 letter <a href=\"https://sashinexists.com/letter/learning-and-language/\">Learning and Language</a></p><hr><h3 id=\"conversation-culture\">Conversation Culture</h3><p>I'm running a group that meets once a week to discuss philosophy, science, culture, where the world is headed and all manner of interesting things.</p><p>The general ethos of conversation culture, is that we believe we can solve problems together and make progress by exchanging words.
